# 🌱 EcoIntelli – AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Sustainability

EcoIntelli** is a conceptual AI-driven platform designed to improve operational efficiency and environmental compliance through predictive maintenance of industrial equipment.

 Objective
To reduce unplanned equipment downtime and optimize resource usage using real-time IoT data and machine learning models — aligning operational goals with sustainability objectives.

 Problem
Industrial operations often suffer from unplanned maintenance, leading to excessive costs, energy wastage, and non-compliance with environmental standards. Traditional maintenance systems lack predictive intelligence.

 Solution
EcoIntelli uses AI to detect anomalies and forecast equipment failures in advance, allowing organizations to:
- Minimize equipment downtime
- Optimize maintenance schedules
- Ensure compliance with environmental regulations

Approach
1. **Data Simulation**: Created IoT sensor data streams representing temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Processed time-series data to extract performance degradation patterns.
3. **Modeling**: Applied machine learning models:
   - **Random Forest**
   - **Neural Networks**
4. **Alerting System**: Triggered maintenance alerts based on anomaly detection.
5. **Visualization**: Created dashboards to monitor live equipment status, failure risk scores, and resource utilization.

 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib
- **SQL**: For querying historical maintenance logs
- **Tableau / Power BI**: For visual dashboards
- **Excel**: For simulation and impact modeling

 Results (Simulated Environment)
- ⏱️ 30% reduction in predicted equipment downtime  
- 💰 25% cost savings in maintenance operations  
- 🌿 100% simulated compliance with environmental standards
